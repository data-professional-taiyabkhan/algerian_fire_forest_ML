            <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
            <p>
                This project is built on the Algerian Forest Fire dataset. The dataset includes information on various meteorological and vegetation-related factors collected across two regions in Algeria.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Temperature, Rain, RH (Relative Humidity), Wind Speed, and FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code).</li>
                <li><strong>Target:</strong> The model predicts whether a forest fire will occur based on these variables.</li>

            <h2>About the Model</h2>
            <p>
                The machine learning model utilizes these variables to provide accurate predictions, helping in proactive fire prevention measures. Techniques like Random Forests and Logistic Regression are employed.
